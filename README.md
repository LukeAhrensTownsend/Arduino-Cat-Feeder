# Arduino Cat Feeder
Have you ever been in the situation where you need to feed your cat but you aren't at home or won't be for a while? The Arduino Cat Feeder was made just for you! The Arduino Cat Feeder allows you to set a specified time which your pet should be fed, and simply opens the food bowl area once the timer is finished. Just fill up the food bowl, set the timer, and away you go! No need to worry if your cat is fed or not. Voila!
